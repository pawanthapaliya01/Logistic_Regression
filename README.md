# Logistic_Regression
    We import the necessary libraries, including NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and scikit-learn.
    We load the Iris dataset, which is a built-in dataset in scikit-learn. 
    EDA steps include displaying the first few rows and summary statistics of the dataset, as well as creating a pairplot to visualize relationships between features.
    The dataset is split into training and testing sets using train_test_split.
    A logistic regression model is created using LogisticRegression() from scikit-learn.
    The model is trained on the training data using fit.
    We make predictions on the test data using predict.
    Model performance is evaluated with accuracy, a classification report, and a confusion matrix.
    We create a mesh grid to plot the decision boundary of the model.
    The decision boundary is plotted along with the test data points.
    We also create a confusion matrix heatmap to visualize the model's performance on the test data.
